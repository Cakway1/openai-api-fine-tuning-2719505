# OpenAI API: Fine-Tuning
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `OpenAI API: Fine-Tuning`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository holds example data and two Jupyter Notebooks:
- `create-training-data/create-training-data.ipynb` demonstrates how to prepare data for fine-tuning
- `fine-tune-flow.ipynb` demonstrates how to perform fine-tuning through the OpenAI API.

The first time you run a block in a Jupyter Notebook, the environment will ask you to pick an environment. Follow the instructions and pick the first available Python environment. 

NOTE: The first code block will take a while to load because the environment has to load first.

## Installing
It is recommended you run these exercise files in GitHub Codespaces. This gives you a pre-configured Python environment for the Jupyter Notebooks to run.
To use the exercise files, follow these steps:
1. In the root folder, rename the file `env-template` to `.env`.
2. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
3. Generate a new key and copy the key to your clipboard.
4. In `.env` add the key without quotes or parentheses.
